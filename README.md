# Nobody's Making the Good Dictionaries Anymore

The philological boom of the 19th and 20th centuries saw the creation of massive lexicons such as *St. Petersburg Dictionary* (Sanskrit), *Thesaurus linguae Latinae*, and *A Dictionary of PƒÅli* (by the Pali Text Society). Lexicon-making is no longer fashionable, meaning that projects such as *A Comprehensive and Critical Dictionary of The Prakrit Languages* are unlikely to ever finish.

However, the appendices of hundreds of text editions and articles contain lists of unusual words, which, if compiled, could easily add many thousands of entries to existing lexicons. This repository collects these appendices in the hope that they can one day be digitized.
